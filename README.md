# My fun things whit JavaScript 

I have created this repository with the purpose of collecting some crazy ideas that came to my mind to do whith JavaScript, CSS and HTML.

My main focus is to force myself to exercice my creativity and also to deepen my JS knowledge 

I've found that the best way to really learn how to program its by doing and thinking for myself!

I hope you like this fun staff!
